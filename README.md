# AlgorithmsFromScratch
This repository contains implementations of various machine learning and deep learning algorithms from scratch, without the use of any machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch). The goal is to understand how these algorithms work at a fundamental level by building them from the ground up.
